# Go REST API

This is a simple REST API for managing a list of movies. It's built using Go and the Gorilla Mux router, and supports the basic CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete).

## Prerequisites

Before you can run this application, you'll need to install the following:

- [Go](https://golang.org/doc/install)
- [Gorilla Mux](https://github.com/gorilla/mux): A powerful HTTP router and URL matcher for building Go web servers.

You can install Gorilla Mux using the following command:

```bash
go get -u github.com/gorilla/mux
